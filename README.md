# CDUI - configuration driven UI
A small library to provide the building blocks to make well-written Angular components configuration driven.
With this, one can configure how components are organized and how data flow are wired between them. 
It could be used to build dynamic pages where a user can customize the layout of widget or make a widget to take data from different other widgets.

The configuration-driven-core module is all that you need.
The demo module creates an Angular app using CDUI. Part of it host the documentation about the internal and the best practices for CDUI.
And another major part of the demo app is an "Olympic App" page which demonstrates how a more sophisticated and realistic web app can be 
fabricated by CDUI. And there's a recently-added live editor page where you can experiment random ideas which existing components.

This is a hobby project and passion driven. There's a lot more we can add (for example, runtime validator). But I'm holding my horses on this project for now.

Some day, I'll run a live instance on my web server.  

For the moment, if you want to play with it:
1. check it out
2. npm ci
3. npm run watch (this just gets the core module built as a lib), after it's up, you can be killed
4. npm run start
